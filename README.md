# Come Watch With Me - Server

This project was started in an effort to let me and my girlfriend watch videos at the same time.

It uses sockets.io to start and pause playback across all connected clients. 

To start the server

``` sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

Server will run on `http://localhost:8080`

Deployed version is running on `http://come-watch-with-me.herokuapp.com`

Client repo located at `https://github.com/kelly-keating/cwwm-client`
